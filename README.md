# Kick-Start
As always, just to be different... This is my "hello world" repository ;)
It is better late than never.
This message is to notify you about my kick-start to move all code I've ever created to GitHub.
There will be repositories about;
  (1) Recursive functions and cost calculation
  (2) Portal solution based on access db.
  (3) Course scheduling & resource management
  (4) Decision support systems for tender documentation development
  (5) Construction specifications development

Above are mostly ready to be shared here;
Below projects are in heavy development and planned for the forthcoming days;
  (6) Virtual Building Information Model for AEC/FM Industry
  (7) An aggregated, loosely coupled model for IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) specification
  (8) Energy+ & OpenStudio Extentions for such
  (9) Cloud based BIM - Tender Documentation gateway

All these efforts were hidden in the Pandora's (in this context "my") box for years. 
Now those will get explicated... Nothing very special actually. I just need help!
This readme will grow up!
