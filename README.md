# Kick-Start
It is better late than never.
This message is to notify you about my kick-start to move all code I've ever created to GitHub.
There will be repositories about;
  (1) Recursive functions and cost calculation (updated and working VBA code as part of Nr.6 will upload in a few weeks from 170606)
  (2) Portal solution based on access db. (old project, will upload in a few weeks from 170606)
  (3) Course scheduling & resource management (ready, will upload in a few weeks from 170606)
  (4) Decision support systems for tender documentation development (old project, will upload in a few weeks from 170606)
  (5) Construction specifications development (looong long ahead...)

Above are mostly ready to be shared here;
Below projects are in heavy development and planned for the forthcoming days;
  (6) Virtual Building Information Model for AEC/FM Industry (almost ready as an Access Database solution - coming soon)
  (7) An aggregated, loosely coupled model for IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) specification (as part of Nr.6)
      This basically seperates geometry and geometric relationships from other parts of the information model
      Makes it possible to contribute any "information dimension" (including geometry) as a plug-in to the unified model.
  (8) Energy+ & OpenStudio Extentions for such (looong long ahead...)
  (9) Cloud based BIM - Tender Documentation gateway (Stuck in limitations of ASP.NET Core... After Nr.6)

All these efforts were hidden in the Pandora's (in this context "my") box for years. 
Now those will get explicated... Nothing very special actually. I just need help!
This readme will grow up!
